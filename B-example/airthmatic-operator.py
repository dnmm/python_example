#+ Addition	Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b = 30
#- Subtraction	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a – b = -10
#* Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	a * b = 200
#/ Division	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b / a = 2
#% Modulus	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	b % a = 0
#** Exponent	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	a**b =10 to the power 20
#//	Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the
'''  quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the 
# operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity) −
# 	9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0'''
